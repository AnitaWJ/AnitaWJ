# Hello my name is Anita Wale-James!!
## Neuroscience Major
### I enrolled in this course because I found it interesting to learn about Neuroscience and coding and how they relate with one another... So far I am enjoying it a lot **(will keep you updated lol)**!! It's definately a different learning style than what I am used to...
### I like the brain and the thought processes of humans... I originally fell in love with psychology but decided to give myself more of a challenge by going into neuro since I love both hehe... its a shame that we can't do both as double major at Dal *sad face emoji lol*. However both land me at the same goal, by God's grace, med school!! YAY!
